### Constants

Constants are variables who's values does not change. In ruby comments start with a capital letter or any variable that is named in `upcase`. Here is an example of how we can define a constant in `ruby`

```rb
MY_CONSTANT = "Hello, world"
puts MY_CONSTANT
```

> Note that constants can not be defined inside a method or a function body.
