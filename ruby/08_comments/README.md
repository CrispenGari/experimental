### Comments in Ruby

Comments are a block of code that get ignored by a compiler or interpreter while executing a code `script`.
We have two types of comments in ruby which are:

1. single line comment

Single line comments start with `#` for example

```rb
# This is an inline comment
```

2. multi-line comments

Multiline comments starts with the word `=begin` and end with `=end` for example:

```rb
=begin
This is a multline comment
=end

```
