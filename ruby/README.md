### Ruby Programs

1. Write a program that simulates a countdown timer.

```rb
require "time"

def timer(max=10)
  while true
    print "\r#{max}s "
    sleep(1)
    max -= 1
    if max < 0
      break
    end
  end
end

timer
timer(5)
```

2. Write a program that will generate a `valid` email address from the user's

- first name(s)
- last name(s)
- company name

From the user's input.

```rb

puts "COMPANY EMAIL GENERATOR"

print "Enter your name(s): "
names = gets.chomp.split.join('.')
print "Enter your surname: "
surname = gets.chomp.split.join('.')
print "Enter your company name: "
com = gets.chomp.split.join

email = names.concat('.').concat(surname).concat('@').concat(com).concat('.com').downcase

puts "Your email address is: #{email}"
```

Output:

```
COMPANY EMAIL GENERATOR
Enter your name(s): crispen tinashe
Enter your surname: Garidzira
Enter your company name: example user
Your email address is: crispen.tinashe.garidzira@exampleuser.com
```

3. Write a grading application that takes in the mark of a student and grade them using the following conditions.

```
70 - 100 (A)
60 - 69 (B)
50 - 59 (C)
45 - 49 (D)
40 - 44 (E)
0 - 39 (U)
```

The program should take the grade mark from the user input

```rb

puts "GRADE SYSTEM"

print "Enter Mark: "
mark = gets.chomp.to_i

grade = case  mark
when 70..100
  "A"
when 60..69
  "B"
when 50..59
  "C"
when 45..49
  "D"
when 40..44
  "E"
when 0..39
  "U"
else
  "\rInvalid Mark"
end
puts "Your Grade is: #{grade}"
```

4. Fibonacci Series is a series of positive integer that start from 0 where the next term is generated by adding the previous 2 terms.

```shell
1 1 2 3 5 8 ...
```

Write a program that will generate the Fibonacci Series that is less than or equal to the number that is taken from the user.

```rb

puts "FIBONACCI SERIES GENERATOR"

print "Enter a number: "
max = gets.chomp.to_i

start = 0
fibo = 1
while fibo < max
  print "#{fibo}, "
  start, fibo = fibo, fibo + start
end
```

Output:

```shell
FIBONACCI SERIES GENERATOR
Enter a number: 100
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,
```
